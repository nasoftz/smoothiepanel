Nextion 480x272 - 4.3" touchscreen

Bored to see all "MKS TFT" display around....than I decided to make my "indipendent" version for original smoothieboard.
I'm testing it using a 4.3" touchscreen Nextion Itead on a corexy style printer (Scott3d Hypercube Evo)
My Nextion custom firmware is able to send (but also) receive gcode, status, commands to/from original unmodified Smoothieboard firmware.
there 's no need to build a custom marlin like mk4duo.
It is able to list and select a file to print directly, reading the internal sdcard slot of the smoothie ..
Still a work in progress
After some more tests, I'llrelease the source code,too
here's a precompiled version of my SmoothiePanel that I'm currently using for my Hypercube Evo,embedded SmoothieMonitor almost working, too
